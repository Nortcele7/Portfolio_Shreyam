                Dancing in the night light and talking with the moon <br>
                In my heart you are mine whether its midnight or noon <br>
                Passing by every temple I pray to God to make you mine <br>
                Swear to God that girl you are simply gorgeous and divine <br>
                In my mind you are engraved and no one can ever erase <br>
                Know I am not good enough but every challenge I am ready to face <br>
                Handing my every prayer to God for you just to make you my girl <br>
                And I promise I will always support you in life in every twist and twirl <br>

                <br>
                Did everything what I could do just to make us together <br>
                Having you in my life by my side is the best thing ever <br>
                I proposed you on veintiuno de febrero and that day is when I fell like love is in the air <br>
                To my life you are a blessing, the best present and my answered prayer <br>
                All I want to say you that thank you for bearing me and being with me when I am feeling blue <br>
                Loving you and being loved by you feels like an impossible dream come true <br>
                <br>

                I just want to thank god for blessing me with this girl who can walk with me even on the flame <br>
                Life feels damn good when I finally have a girl who thinks me as a blessing rather than shame <br>
                Yes, and to all wondering the primeros catorce letters make her beautiful name <br>
