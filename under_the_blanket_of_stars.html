                <br>
                That day, you were telling me that in the past stars in the sky looked crystal clear <br>
                But I knew from start that my life is crystal clear only when I am with you my dear <br>
                You were the fairy of my life, prettier and gorgeous than everyone I know <br>
                And I purely loved you whether there was flood of happiness or blood of sorrow <br>


            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                I fell in love with you when I saw you for the first time in the month of August <br>
                And for me, girl you were the one and only person whom I can blindly trust <br>
                I was pretty positive and confident that we were made for each other <br>
                And I was damn sure that no matter what we will end up together <br>




            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                But girl, later I found out that we being together was my complete delusion <br>
                And what I ecstatically imagined about our future life was only an illusion <br>
                Without bidding a final goodbye to me girl you were gone <br>
                And even if I didn’t want to, from you I had to move on <br>




            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">
              
                <br>
                I feel like our delusional love story is just like of the Avengers <br>
                Later we crossed our paths once more but this time as strangers <br>
                You didn’t even look at me and drifted far apart instead of coming near <br>
                And girl you were right that in the past when I had you stars looked crystal clear <br>
