                Life lately has not been the same as it used to be <br>
                And I feel like connected to somebody and I can’t be free <br>
                Only noticed her and I don’t really know the things that I missed <br>
                And I am confused that, for her, Do I even exist? <br>

            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                Might just be a forced conversation which I always start <br>
                And I might be hitting on the right target with the wrong dart <br>
                I know that even if I try, I can’t actually be apart <br>
                My mind is playing games with me but not my heart <br>



            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                I think I could never confess to her that how much I care <br>
                I could never gain the courage to face her glamorous glare <br>
                I know others will confess to her soon and she might well accept <br>
                After that I will be on my very own and nothing will be left <br>



            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">
              
                <br>
                She is a treasure that I always cherished but couldn’t get <br>
                She is the gift who is prettier than evening pink sunset <br>
                And I am trying still, doing my best of efforts <br> 
                But I can’t show it to her and write it only in words <br>
