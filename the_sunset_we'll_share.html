                The sun is at the horizon and the sky is crimson red <br>
                I am feeling blessed because my arm is holding your head <br>
                I find myself lucky because I am sharing the sunset with you <br>
                And its my promise to you that we’ll share the morning sunrise too <br>

                We’ll enjoy the chocolate bars and your favourite ice-cream cones <br>
                And for me you are more precious than the world’s rarest gemstones <br>
                We are made for each other and I promise we’ll never get into fight <br>
                And if we ever get on the brink of separation, I promise to make things right <br>

                <br>
                The sun has finally set and now the moon is shining bright <br>
                But girl your eyes shine brighter even brighter than the starlight <br>
                I believe that we are made for each other and our love Is very strong <br>
                And I promise you that I will try my best to make things right if ever it goes wrong <br>

                <br>
                When I saw you for the first time I believed in love at first sight <br>
                For me you are my princess, the prettiest, even prettier than snow white <br>
                You are truly magical and I always fall in love when I see your dazzling eyes <br>
                And girl as I got you by my side, I have already claimed my prize <br>
