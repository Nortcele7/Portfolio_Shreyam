                Our conversations ended years ago but the memories remain still <br>
                I know I desperately loved you then and I know I always will <br>
                And I know we haven’t talked with each other for a while <br>
                I just wanna know remembering our pasts do you ever smile <br>

                <br>
                I know that I am the one whom you might not want to remember <br>
                But in my lifetime I will never forget that snowy cold December <br>
                You might have forgotten December and the promises we made <br>
                I hope your life will be colourful, in which I am just a filthy shade <br>

                <br>
                I tried reaching out to you wanted to make things right <br>
                But you have already moved on leaving me at a distant sight <br>
                You argued with me, accused me that I was the one who didn’t blend <br>
                And soon after I got blocked and I had to accept our end <br>

                <br>
                We started our conversation in December and ended it in June <br>
                Even I have moved on but I always remember you when I see the moon <br>
                I am not trying to say that we should be together nor regretting our separation <br>
                But I am trying to say is, together we would have reached a beautiful destination <br>
