                <br>
                We shared all of our dreams and imagined a happy life <br>
                But it later became hard, like driving the edge of a knife <br>
                It happened because we both were not ready and mature enough <br>
                And we at least could have tried, but trying was actually tough <br>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                We both shared pretty good vibes and loved hanging out <br>
                But our paths didn’t align and now I am crying out loud <br>
                Promises that we made might have just gone in vain <br>
                Don’t know about you but I am feeling its intense pain <br>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                We were not just meant to be and there’s no one to blame <br>
                I might just be a simple player in your sweet life’s game <br>
                I was not capable enough to cross your standard bars <br>
                And us being together is just not written in the stars <br>



            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">
              
                <br>
                And now we are in different paths of our lives forever <br> 
                And now we are never ever getting back together <br>
                We could rewrite the stars if we tried but now it’s too late <br>
                And referring to you as my girl is not in my fate <br>
