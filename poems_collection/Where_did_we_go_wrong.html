            I cherished each and every moment I got to spend with you <br>
            But I never got the chance to make you mine because you loved someone new <br>
            I believed that I had no luck to get you and I was kind of late <br>
            But whom to blame when I didn’t have you as my girl in my fate <br>

            I will always love you and the part in my life where I had you was sweet <br>
            I can fight and sacrifice too for your love but sorry that I can’t compete <br>
            I didn’t want to stop trying because I believed trying will give us everything <br>
            But I had to stop, when I found out, I was not the one who would give you the ring <br>

            I felt like we have a connection, a connection that can’t be torn apart <br>
 But it was my delusion and now all that remains is my wretched heart <br>
 I don’t know why my heart is heavy and I don’t like this heavy shit <br>
 And I guess, I can’t fix my heart which had forgotten to beat for the one who broke it <br>

            Our relation never got the chance to make it out of the mobile screen <br>
 And I had to let it go when I found out that some hearts are not meant to interwine <br>
 I lost against your love and I guess I was the one who wasn’t capable to blend <br>
 And I tried to rewrite our stories but some stories are meant to have a sad end <br>
