            When they say that I always say your name in my prayers that’s kind of true <br>
            But I never prayed to God make you mine rather I pray to make me worthy of you <br>
            I know the flaws that I have in me and day by day I try to improve it <br>
            And that’s because I just want to be good for you since you are my heartbeat <br>

            I always remember you and there is not a single hour that passes without your name <br>
 And I always seek to be with you with hope that together we will play life’s beautiful game <br>
 Just like for revolving electron, neutron is the center, you are the center for my heart <br>
 And just like electron, my revolving heart can neither come close to you nor drift apart

            I always tried to be close with you but you didn’t notice and I guess that it’s my fate <br>
            Hoped for the happy sunrise in my life but was rather gifted with sad sunset <br>
            And guess we were like the sun and moon who can never ever meet each other <br>
            And when its not written in the stars, then no amount of efforts can make us together <br>

            And I think that you are that chapter of my life that I didn’t want to ever turn <br>
 But this chapter was even more beautiful than the gorgeous rings of  <br>
 Closing this chapter was the only option left and guess that’s how it went <br>
 And I torn apart those thousands of letters that were really never sent <br>
