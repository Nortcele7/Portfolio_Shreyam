            Dazzling eyes of yours makes me feel like I am watching stars at night <br>
            But your eyes shine even brighter than those twinkling starlight <br>
            Even I know, I have no chance to get you, still I did put everything in <br>
            And I really hoped that, after lots of losses in life I will finally get my win <br>

            I didn’t care about the world telling me that I should stop falling for you <br>
            But if you had told me to stop, I would have completely stopped and that’s actually true <br>
            And I was 99% sure that we won’t be together and never ever talk again <br>
            But that 1% was making me go, so that I can clear my feelings so that no pain remain <br>

            When I looked you for the first time, I found you prettier than the pink sunset <br>
            I really hoped that you were the other end of my red string of fate <br>
            Later on, I realized I was completely delusional about you and your action <br>
            I identified you as my better half but for you I was not even a fraction <br>

            But in December we stopped talking and it was the last time you said goodbye <br>
 And from that moment, I finally realized that you were my fish upon the sky <br>
 When you finally decided to walk out of my life, the pain in my life really started to grow <br>
 And I realized that, its not the goodbyes that hurt but it’s the flashbacks that follow <br>
