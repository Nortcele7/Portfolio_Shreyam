            He loved her purely and every time he sees her or even thinks about her his emotions go burst <br>
            But every time he wants to text her, he realizes that there is a guy in her life who doesn’t have to text first <br>
            He genuinely fell in love with her and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her <br>
            But she also loved someone new and his all of the efforts doesn’t even matter <br>

            When the infinite efforts that he did for her went in vain, he felt immense pain <br>
 He tried to forget this part of his life but circumstances made him remember again and again <br>
 This was the most beautiful chapter in his life but he did want to forget it <br>
 And now the only thing he ever wishes for, is that they never ever meet <br>

            He wanted to be with her and support her as well as stand for her when he was there <br>
 She was the girl of his fondest dreams but in her life, he was just like a nightmare <br>
 After realizing that she doesn’t have interest in him he got out of his mind and lost his track <br>
 Guess there’s a special kind of pain in waiting for someone who he knew is never coming back <br>

            He lost her in every universe and this is what we call A Life’s Merciless and Dreadful game <br>
 He didn’t regret loving her but regretted his hope thinking that she would feel the same <br>
 He loved her girl of dreams and so she did with her man of dreams and there is no one to blame <br>
 But the saddest part is watching someone you love, fall in love with someone else in the same way you fell for them <br>
