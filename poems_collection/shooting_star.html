            Every time when I stare at the night sky, I hope to see a shooting star just to say your name <br>
 I had lost several times in my life but this time I wanted to win this life’s game <br>
 You were the one who used to light up my mood and cheer me up in my lows <br>
 And the more I tried to detach from you and unlove you, the more love grows <br>

            The world says that you only get that person if that person is written in your fate <br>
            And I hoped you were that person with whom I walk together and cross each of life’s gate <br>
            I never told you that you were my crush but dropped so many hints along the way <br>
            But you didn’t notice those hints and now we are just drifting apart and fading away <br>

            The shooting star didn’t grant my wish to get you and that’s actually fine <br>
            I guess there is no one to blame except my fate, where I can never make you mine <br>
            We had to take different paths in our life and our relation was torn apart <br>
            And everybody told me about a new start but they didn’t know about my shattered heart <br>

            And even after all this I hoped that one day we will be together and find a way <br>
            I was a single star in the night sky hoping to be seen but you gazed at galaxies far away <br>
            But every time when I stare at the night sky, I hope to see a shooting star just to say your name <br>
            But I guess no matter how many times I read the book, the ending is always same <br>
