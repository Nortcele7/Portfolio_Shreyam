            When I saw you in college, I believed in love at first sight <br>
            After I looked at you, I felt like my dark world is shining bright <br>
            You didn’t even give me attention and I was nobody for you <br>
            But I really love you girl and all the promises I made is actually true <br>

            We started talking on insta after completing high school <br>
            Can’t even say a mutual talk because for you I was just a fool <br>
            Kept on getting ignored in messages but I didn’t care <br>
            And I was just a fool that thought we have something to share <br>

            You just could have said no and I could’ve moved on <br>
 And I wouldn’t have been devastated, now that you are gone <br>
 Why you keep on talking with me even you had zero attraction <br>
 I identified you as my better half but for you I was not even a
 fraction <br>

            I knew I had no chance but you just gave me some belief <br>
 Should’ve told already that you loved flower but not this leaf <br>
 I guess I was the undeserved one and now my all efforts are in vain <br>
 I am sorry for texting you and I promise I won’t ever again <br>
