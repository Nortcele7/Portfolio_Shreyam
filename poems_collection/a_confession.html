          If I sent you this poem believe me its my confession <br>
          I just want you to know that you are my complete obsession <br>
          It was morning of 21st August when you came into my sight <br>
          And from that day you are my sunshine and my moonlight <br>

          I had dedicated a poem to you but you didn’t even noticed <br>
                And you are the only girl who is on top of my manifestation list <br>
                To make you notice me I had tried million different ways <br>
                But nothing worked out for me and only failure stays <br>

          I know I am not good enough for you and you might love someone new <br>
          But I always pray to God just to make me completely worthy for you <br>
          You are my fondest wish and I may not be even in your wildest dreams <br>
          But girl you are so pretty, even prettier than morning sunlight beams <br>

          Your smile is as bright as the stars and attitude is seemingly bold <br>
          You are exceptionally gorgeous and even prettier than rose gold <br>
          Your humour is so nice and your way of talking is what I like the most <br>
          And after looking into your eyes for the very first day I had already been lost <br>

          I don’t know why I am writing this even knowing you won’t ever be mine <br>
                But how can I not write this for you when you are my only sunshine <br>
                I know I may be the most boring person on your following list <br>
                But after writing this I am hoping one day I will get noticed <br>
