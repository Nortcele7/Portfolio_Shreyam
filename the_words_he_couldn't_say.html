                This is the story of a guy in the form of poem specially about his heart <br>
                And how his heart bore the pain of his and his beloved drifting far apart <br>
                He didn’t have the courage to say that she was the silver lining to his dark cloud <br>
                And it’s not the silence that haunts him, but its the words that he could never speak out loud <br>

                He had a crush on her for a long time and guess in terms of love, he was pretty late <br>
                He wanted to say, the moon is beautiful, isn’t it, but was forced to say sunset <br>
                He tried so hard to get her and did so much efforts just to be with her <br>
                But he never showed it to her and due to which he always used to suffer <br>

                He always believed that efforts to matter so he decided to give a final throttle <br>
                It took some time but eventually he realized that he was just nursing an empty bottle <br>
                And that realization left him with immense pain, enduring scars and bruises <br>
                He can beat the world for her but can’t beat the man she chooses <br>

                He always thought about her and always loved her but she didn’t care <br>
                And some stories don’t have a happy ending rather they are destined to end in despair <br>
                He never gave up on her and she never gave up on him and in life both were quiet free <br>
                It would be an amazing story if it was of 2 persons but unfortunately it was of three <br>
