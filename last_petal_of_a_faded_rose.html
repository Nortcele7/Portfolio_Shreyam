                I purely loved you and kept on loving you from the core of my heart <br>
                But I didn’t realize instead of being together rather we are drifting apart <br>
                Every time I saw your smile, I fell in love with you again and again <br>
                And now you are gone, only some unanswered questions remain <br>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                These questions remain fully unanswered because I didn’t ask you <br>
                And believe me I tried hard but failed and guess that’s what life do <br>
                You may not share the same feelings with me and I totally understand why <br>
                But how can I move on when I remember you every time, I see the sky <br>

                I had a crush on you since the beginning of our eleventh grade <br>
                You were the rainbow of my life but for you I was just a shade <br>
                We got diverged by our paths because to us our destiny was calling <br>
                I guessed our love blossomed like rose but never noticed the petals falling <br>

                I was completely into you girl, when I saw you for the first time <br>
                And if we were together, I guess my life would be pretty sublime <br>
                For me you were the red rose which I saw in the garden from the bars <br>
                Didn’t imagined that instead of giving touch of softness, it would give me scars <br>
