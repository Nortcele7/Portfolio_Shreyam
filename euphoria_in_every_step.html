                I am feeling happy lately, maybe its because I got to talk with you <br>
                And I feel like I know you pretty much even if I know very few <br>
                I don’t know but I feel like we are connected to each other <br>
                And even if I am delusional, I just want us to be forever together <br>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                I wanna spend the sunset with you and also wanna see the sunrise <br>
                I fell in love again and again with you when ever I see your dazzling eyes <br>
                For you, I want to be caring and understanding to solve any of our issue <br>
                And if ever you broke down into tears by life, I want to be your tissue <br>


            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                Whenever I am in a bad mood, your message lights me up <br>
                And for us, I want to buy the gifts from your best gift shop <br>
                I just wanna enjoy my life with you by my side in Santorini’s beach <br>
                And I just want to make you mine even if you are out of my reach <br>



            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">
              
                <br>
                I never have hanged out with you and I really want to hangout <br>
                And if ever you need me in your life, I promise I will standout <br>
                I will always love you because for me you are the best even at your worst <br>
                Because you have already stolen my heart when I saw you on August 21st <br>
