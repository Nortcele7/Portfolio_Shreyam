                I cherished each and every moment I got to spend with you <br>
                But I never got the chance to make you mine because you loved someone new <br> 
                I believed that I had no luck to get you and I was kind of late <br> 
                But whom to blame when I didn’t have you as my girl in my fate <br>  


            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                I will always love you and the part in my life where I had you was sweet <br>
                I can fight and sacrifice too for your love but sorry that I can’t compete <br>
                I didn’t want to stop trying because I believed trying will give us everything <br>
                But I had to stop, when I found out, I was not the one who would give you the ring <br>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                I felt like we have a connection, a connection that can’t be torn apart <br> 
                But it was my delusion and now all that remains is my wretched heart <br>
                I don’t know why my heart is heavy and I don’t like this heavy shit <br>
                And I guess, I can’t fix my heart which had forgotten to beat for the one who broke it <br>

                <br>
                Our relation never got the chance to make it out of the mobile screen <br>
                And I had to let it go when I found out that some hearts are not meant to interwine <br>
                I lost against your love and I guess I was the one who wasn’t capable to blend <br>
                And I tried to rewrite our stories but some stories are meant to have a sad end <br>
