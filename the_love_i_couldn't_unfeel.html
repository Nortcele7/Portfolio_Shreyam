                You will never know how much I loved you and how many times I fell for you <br>
                And you will never understand how much I wished that you felt the same I do <br>
                I was trying to be close to you but you were the one who was drifting away <br>
                Knowing you would never ever catch me, I kept falling for you anyway <br>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                You were my true and pure love that I expected to last for ages <br>
                And I wrote poems for you but you never turned the pages <br>
                I was just trying to make you mine because I loved you and that’s true <br>
                It hurts to know that you are happy without me in a way I could never be without you <br>





            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                Now, I am finally letting you go and I know now that from my life you will be gone <br>
                And letting go is not the hardest part rather it’s realizing that you never wanted to hold on <br>
                I wrote the words for you in the sand but it was constantly washing away by tide <br>
                And I learned the hard way that love is real even if it is only felt on one side <br>



            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">
              
                <br>
                For me, you were the world, but for you, my presence was just like a drama show <br>
                And sometimes, the heart holds on to something that the mind knows it should let go <br>
                And I guess I can never unlove you and you also felt the same way for someone new <br>
                And it’s not the emptiness that hurts, what hurts is that emptiness is perfectly filled by you <br>
