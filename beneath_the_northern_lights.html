                This scene feels so magical and I donâ€™t want the sun to rise <br>
                Only thing, I can compare with the Northern Lights is your shiny eyes <br>
                We both are under the northern lights and enjoying the magical view <br>
                And I really loved this time because I got to spend this time with you <br>

                Watching this view together is magical and it makes us forget our stress <br>
                And as I am with you, I am feeling great although my life is a mess <br>
                Aurora Borealis is magical and beautiful and we both are impressed <br>
                And I got to watch this scene with you, for this I am really blessed <br>

                <br>
                I am just happy that we are watching this scene together <br>
                And I just want to be with you and only you forever <br>
                I just want the time to pause so I can enjoy the night <br>
                I just want to spend time with you under these northern light <br>

                <br>
                I just hope that we will be successful in our careers and stick together <br> 
                I just want us to support, encourage and always stand for each other <br>
                And I know we will never ever leave each other apart <br>
                And because of this sole reason you have stolen my heart <br>
