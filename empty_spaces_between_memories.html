                Life lately has not been good and I have been tired for a while <br>
                It’s been years and years since I last saw your pretty smile <br>
                We made pretty good memories we probably couldn’t forget <br>
                And those feelings which we once loved has transformed into hate <br>

                <br>
                We loved each other and promised we will never ever be apart <br>
                But because of circumstances it ended before even being start <br>
                And after all these years, remembering you I still cry <br>
                I know I shouldn’t but it’s really hard to say goodbye <br>

                <br>
                We ended our conversation forever with dispute and hate <br>
                And we could’ve worked things out but now it’s too late <br>
                We promised to love each other up until our last breath <br>
                But these promises couldn’t save our relationship’s death <br>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">
              
                <br>
                I know I have not seen you or talked to you in years <br>
                And after we broke apart my life is filled with tears <br>
                I wanted you and you were the only one whom I can trust <br>
                Even we are not together but I will never ever forget August <br>
