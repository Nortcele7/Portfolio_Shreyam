                So, after all of the text we sent, <br>
                And all of those cuddling in the tent, <br>
                All after those good morning messages and heartfelt goodbyes too, <br>
                Am I just a friend to you? <br>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                After all of the feelings we shared with each other, <br>
                And all those promises saying that we will always be together, <br>
                Now, I got to know you love someone new, <br>
                And now, I am just a friend to you <br>





            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                After, all those little secrets to pretty gifts, <br>
                After all those late calls from our night shifts, <br>
                After all those convincing messages I thought our love is true, <br>
                But now you are saying I am just a friend to you <br>



            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">
              
                <br>
                What I always wanted was to make you mine, <br>
                But still if I am just a friend to you, its fine, <br>
                I always loved you from the bottom of my heart and its true, <br>
                But now I am drifting myself apart because I cannot be just friend with you <br>
