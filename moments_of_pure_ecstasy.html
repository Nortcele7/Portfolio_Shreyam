                <br>
                I just feel pure euphoria when I see your message or call <br>
                And I just want to hangout with you girl even if its just a small stroll <br>
                My love for you is pure and for me you are beyond comparison <br>
                I love you always and forever in each and every beautiful season <br>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                Your voice is like the chirping sound, which, spring’s cuckoo bird makes <br>
                For me you are the prettiest, even prettier than winter snow flakes <br>
                Your smile is more beautiful, than the autumn’s glorious maple trees <br>
                And the memories we made last summer are sweeter than the honey made by bees <br>



            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                I don’t know you fully and I always seek to know you well <br>
                For me you are like the princess straight out of a fairy tale <br>
                You are the one blessing who can make me able to break every curse <br>
                And I promise that I will stick with you not only in this world but in every universe <br>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">
              
                <br>
                I just want to be with you forever girl and that’s my only desire <br>
                And I feel like our hearts are connected together by some invisible wire <br>
                I promise that if ever you feel low, I will hold your head in my arm <br>
                And I for me you are the luckiest because you are my lucky charm <br>
