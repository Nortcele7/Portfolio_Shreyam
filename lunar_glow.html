                Stepped outside in the gardens and saw a lightning jewel <br>
                Saw you in only nights, don’t know why God is cruel <br>
                Maybe you are only meant for the nights, to make them shine <br>
                And I whispered to myself that your presence makes the night divine <br>

                <br>
                Never saw your back face and only front was enough <br>
                Since you will be gone, welcoming the day is always tough <br>
                Even you are not in day, the day seems pretty fine <br>
                But the night becomes more gorgeous because of your moonshine <br>

                <br>
                Saying goodbye to the night is hardest because you will be gone <br>
                And staying up all day without you is like sitting on throne <br>
                We might not be united in day but will always be in night <br>
                And you are the only one who makes my life bright <br>

                You may have 8 different phases but I like them all <br>
                Even in new moon I don’t find you dull <br>
                Many people say that your phase as full moon is elegant <br>
                But in all of your 8 phases I find you excellent <br>
