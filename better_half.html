                <br>
                She is the one who holds my complete trust,<br>
                Her smile ignites my emotions with a burst <br>
                Her innocence brings endless laughter to me, <br>
                And I long to be with my perfect harmony. <br>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                She understands the sorrows I’ve endured, <br>
                She sees the passions with which I’m assured. <br>
                Yet she remains unaware that she is my dream, <br>
                And making her mine feels like an impossible scheme. <br>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                She isn’t present on any social media site, <br>
                Nowhere to be found, not even in Wikipedia's light. <br>
                She doesn’t realize how deeply I am drawn, <br>
                Her absence leaves me in sorrow from dusk till dawn. <br>


            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">
              
                <br>
                Yet in my heart, a hope gently thrives, <br>
                That fate might align our parallel lives. <br>
                Perhaps someday, our paths will entwine, <br>
                And I’ll finally call her truly mine. <br>


            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">
                
                <br>
                Until then, I cherish the dreams we share, <br>
                Hoping for a moment when she'll be aware. <br>
                For in my soul, she's my endless song, <br>
                My better half, where my heart belongs. <br>
