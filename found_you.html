                Entered the college gates and sat on my desk <br>
                And I saw somebody who was prettier than snow flakes <br>
                After seeing you my wretched heart became fortunate <br>
                After the moment I saw you, I always thanked my fate <br>

                21st August 2022 was the date to be exact <br>
                After that your memories made my mind stacked <br>
                I was yearning so much knowing you can’t be mine <br>
                But one thing I am sure that girl you are divine <br>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                I found you but you didn’t even noticed me <br>
                And I am sure that you have never ever missed me <br>
                But I really miss you girl every single day <br>
                “Make her mine” is always what I pray <br>

                Searched you through social media but you weren’t there <br>
                I am searching you all day and you don’t even care <br>
