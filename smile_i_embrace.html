                Before I saw you, I was a normal guy with no interest in love <br>
                But when I saw you, I felt like you are an angel from the heaven above <br>
                That day we didn’t talk and didn’t even look at each other <br>
                But later that day I prayed to God to please make us together <br>



            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                For me you are more beautiful than those gorgeous Saturn’s rings <br>
                And your voice is melodious even more than when cuckoo bird sings <br>
                I didn’t even care about love and feelings until I found you <br>
                But after that day, I kept on getting those feelings and ever since it always grew <br> 



            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">

                <br>
                I love you always and forever and more than I could ever express <br>
                And you are the one by talking with whom I smile even my life is a mess <br>
                I wish to get you but even more I pray to God to make me worthy for you <br>
                And the promises that I make about you are not fake but it’s all actually true <br>



            </div>

            <div id="better_half_stanzas">
              
                <br>
                When you smile and laugh, it lights up my sad and depresses mood <br>
                And girl you are perfect whether you are soft or too much rude <br>
                I love your smile and its beautiful every time no matter how much I look at it <br>
                And I hope that you would be mine because girl you are my heartbeat <br>
